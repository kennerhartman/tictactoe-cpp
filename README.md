# Tic-tac-toe in C

I have made a game of Tic-tac-toe before using [Javascript](https://github.com/kennerhartman/tictactoe-js) and [C](https://github.com/kennerhartman/tictactoe-c/), so I thought about make a console based game of Tic-tac-toe using C++!  (The code in C++ does not differ much compared to what I did in C!)

# Compiling and Running the Program

Compiler used: GNU G++

To compile and run the program, 

(1) git clone https://github.com/kennerhartman/tictactoe-cpp.git

Ensure you have the GNU G++ compiler and ```make``` installed to compile ```.cpp``` files and run Makefiles.  In the console,

(2) make main

(3) ./main or ./main.exe

# Other Notes

Could I use headers?  Yes.  Did I learn much?  No.  As stated above, the code I used to make tic-tac-toe in C and C++ does not differ significantly.  The only real difference is how I am outputting to the console and how I am taking in input from the console.
